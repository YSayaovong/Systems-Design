# Systems-Design

Systems Design 
Learning Objectives
Engages in actions with the understanding that they have the potential to lead to both gains or losses.
Articulates the idea to diverse audiences.
Identifies and works with individuals with complementary skill sets, expertise, etc.
Integrates/synthesizes different kinds of knowledge.
Gathers data to support and refute ideas.
Applies technical skills/knowledge to the development of a technology/product.
Modifies an idea/product based on feedback.
Topic
Do you have your Design Team hats (architect, system engineer, developer, database architect)?  It is time to use the Requirements and start Designing. Now, you are going to determine HOW the system will be built.  The goal is to provide the complete design of your technology solution, which is the ‘blueprint’.   It is expected that when you start building the system, you may need to adjust the design document or the requirement document.  For now, you are going to document your design based on existing requirements (if you find that you need to document more requirements to meet your project concept, then DO IT). 

Keep in mind that you are documenting HOW it will all be built.  If you gave this document to another person, would they be able to understand what needs to be done to make your technology product work successfully?   The system development life cycle provides techniques and deliverables that all systems engineers perform to ensure quality in the technology solution from planning to design: Many companies do a combination of methods from Waterfall to Agile/Scrum. 

The planning, analysis, and design are done in a structured method (Waterfall).  Presently, you are doing the waterfall process because you have done the project planning, requirements and now you are working on the design.  When you start building your technology solution, you may use a reiterative approach for programming and testing (i.e., Agile/Scrum). Agile methods focus on delivering a viable product to the user, then continually building on it. You will start with a basic build and keep building on it to meet all the requirements that you stated in your requirements document.

Instructions
 Using what you have learned in the required reading, previous assignments, pre-requisite courses, personal knowledge, and research, complete the systems design items listed below. 

Before you work on the assignment you should have read the following chapters in the required textbook.

Chapter 8: User Interface Design
Chapter 9: Data Design
Chapter 10: System Architecture
This will require some research and creativity.  For example, your UI diagrams that represent forms in the system should be designed in a way that incorporates the guidelines found in the book (Chapter 8).  

You can use tools such as draw.io (Links to an external site.), google drawings (Links to an external site.), and Microsoft Visio.  

You should have at least one network diagram (hint: options here could be the authentication protocol,  and one entity-relationship diagram (hint: Asset, Stockroom, Employee tables, and any other data you determine will need to be stored).  You should have several UI diagrams for the various process, data entry, and edit forms.  

Systems Design Items
Background
From the System Planning Project Charter:  Problem Statement and Technology Solution Statement.
From the System Analysis Requirements: 
Process Maps.   
Make a Table that has Function Purpose and corresponding Requirements. Requirements bullet, single space.
table that has two columns:  Function and Requirements 

User Interface
Create a mockup of the Graphic User Interface (GUI) that matches each of the Process Maps.  Describe each mockup.
Here is an example of a webpage mockup:   
hand written illustration of a mock up web site  

Infrastructure Architecture
Create an infrastructure diagram (network topology)  that displays the devices and servers.   
Example:  Network Topology Example.pdf
Describe the infrastructure that will be required for the technology solution to be implemented in a company.  
Information Architecture
Create an entity-relationship diagram. 
Describe the entities and relationships. 
Use this format:  Entity Relationship Diagram Format.pdf
Security Architecture
Explain how the security requirements support authentication, authorization, and privacy in  terms of risks and controls.
Programming - research and provide recommendations for development tools, technologies, COTS platforms (commercial off-the-shelf platforms), and programming language(s):
List the development tools that you will use and why?
List the programming languages that you will use and why?
